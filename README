To Run Demo: Be capable of running PHP, point Apache (or webserver of choice) at this directory, and visit the index.html file.

The index file sets up the basic html and includes the js libraries.  Event handlers are added in application.js (this file contains the javascript that I wrote). I adapted a popular time ago in words library to meet your requirements and that code is contained in the timeago.js file.

The file ajax.php receives the form posts and returns a JSON representation of the object.

I was unable to download the reply icon from dropbox.  I have substituted a 16x16 image that I screen-captured from the assignment PDF.

Regarding the bonus question, I'll be happy to give it a shot this weekend but wanted to get you the code for the assignment now.  Is the bonus question meant as simply a challenge to write clever code or is it a question of how would you implement this if it were truly required for a program?  I admit we discussed this issue at work between a few people.  Our general consensus was that you should not compute it.  You should store the numbers in a hard coded array and return them.  The set of the first 1000 prime numbers is a static set of information and should not be computed over and over again.
