To Run Demo: Be capable of running PHP, point Apache at this directory, and visit the index.html file.

The file ajax.php receives the form posts and returns a JSON representation of the object.

The main javascript is in application.js.  I adapted a popular time ago in words library to meet your requirements and that code is contained in the timeago.js file.

I have included primes.html which includes a link to run a rather naive attempt at the first thousand primes problem-- though it is likely to crash your browser.  Shouldn't the numbers be stored in a database or flat file if not simply hard coded into the javascript?
