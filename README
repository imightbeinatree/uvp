To Run Demo: Point Apache at this directory and be able to run PHP.

The index.html file is the main page.

The ajax.php file receives the form posts and returns JSON.

My main javascript is in application.js.  I adapted a popular time ago in words library to meet your requirements and that code is contained in the timeago.js file.

I have included primes.html which includes a link to run a rather naive attempt at the first thousand primes issue though it is likely to crash your browser.  Shouldn't the numbers be stored in a database or flat file if not simply hard coded into the javascript?
